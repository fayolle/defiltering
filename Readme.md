# Reverse filtering 
A simple implementation (in MATLAB) of this [paper](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11760-021-01889-3) on reverse filtering (or defiltering). 

## Notes 
The file 'defiltering4sivp.m' contains a stand-alone implementation of the ```P``` and ```S``` methods described in the paper, as well as the ```T``` method. 
The provided example reverse filters the bilateral filter.
